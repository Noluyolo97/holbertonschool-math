0x02. Math - Integrals and ODE

Code the Rectangle Method and use it to calculate 
Prototype: double rectangle_method(double a, double b, int steps );
You can use the library <math.h> in your code

Code the Simpson Method and use it to calculate 
Prototype: double simpson(double a, double b, int steps );
You can use the library <math.h> in your code

Code the Euler Method to solve the ODE , with initial values  and 
Prototype: void Euler(FILE *euler, char *name,double x0, double y0, double T, int n).
You can use the library <math.h> in your code.
You should add the result of Euler Method to a .txt file.

With Gnuplot, plot the solution of the Pendulum equation with  and return the result in the file ode.png using mutiple .txt files generated by using the Euler method of previous task.
